            8/20/23-Week 1 <br> We created an acount on AWS and github. We also learned about OSHA and how to be safe when engineering.<br>We started coding today as you can see. We learned about the engineering process and how its simmilar to the scientific process
        </p>
<p>
    8/28/23-Week 2 <br> We took the safety quiz today.We also did a worksheet on how inventions changed our way of living. We started tinkercad<br> at first we played around with all the tools and stuff then we started a challenge which was to make a household<br> appliance and I made a hair dryer. We also started desinging our Ruth goldberg machines.

    9/4/23-Week 3 <br> We finshed our tinkercad Rube Goldberg machine using simple machines. We also finsihed our Mechanical engineering worksheet,<br> we also watched a crash couse on the history of engineering. We took a quiz on the mechanical engineering worksheet.

    9/11/23 Week 4 <br> We started creating the Rube Goldberg machine with cardboard and got really far. We finished our machine and it popped our<br> ballon. We  used these three simple machines like Lever,inclined plane, and wheels and axel. It was a challenge<br> making the tinkercad into real life.

    9/18/23-Week 5 <br> On Monday we reviewed how to add videos into our website. On Tuesday we did two challenges, the first one was you had to build a boat<br> only using paper and tape, mine lasted two minutes and 40 seconds. My boat was shell shaped and floated.<br>The second challenge was we had at design an E by adding measurements then someone else would make it. We started a worksheet about computer engineering.

    9/25/23-Week 6 <br> We disected a computer and learned about the different parts like the CPU(Central processing unit), motherboard, cooling system, and GPU(Graphical processing unit) the CPU usually is the part that does the "computing" taking in an input and spewwing<br> an output, the motherboard is the circuitry tha powers or tells what, and when to do. The GPU is what creates your FPS or frames per second it is the graphical aspect of the computer.

       10/2/23-Week 7 <br> We learned about bioengineering and how it is the same and or different from mechanical engineering, we also did a worksheet because of the slides. we created a hand prothestic using cardboard and string.Our hand worked but it only worked once. We also created a tinkercad about a prothestic for an animal I created a leg prothesic for a Secratary bird.

        10/9/23-Week 8 <br> We started to learn about areospace engineering, it is engineering that is for planes, rockets, missiles, and satalettes literary anything that is in the air. We tinkercaded a 3d design for a rocket/planes that will be launch with air pressure. I chose this design because I have seen it in real life and i chose the pointy apex because it will be more aerodinamic.

        10/16/23-Week 9 <br> We created the bottle rocket we designed in tinkercad. Then we tested it but I was not there so I couldn't do it

        10/23/23-Week 10 <br> We learned about environmental engineering, it is about keeping us health by providing clean water and other items. We created a water filter made of cotton, rocks, sand, pebbles and coke bottles the first layer was made of cotton then sand then pebbles then rocks. Our filtered water was piss yellow.

        10/30/23-Week 11 <br> We learned about electrical engineering, it is about makung circits and makes electrical appliances. We learned about ressistance, current, voltage. We created different curcits in tinkercad by looking at the schematic one was a series circit and the other a with a parrallel.

        11/6/23-Week 12 <br> We created the circuits we made in tinkercad to a real life breadboard it was pretty easy because I understood how the breadboards worked,A challenge I faced was somtimes the wires would not go in, and i was scared to push in the wires harder because i thought it might break
