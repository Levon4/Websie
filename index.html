            8/20/23-Week 1 <br> We created an acount on AWS and github. We also learned about OSHA and how to be safe when engineering.<br>We started coding today as you can see. We learned about the engineering process and how its simmilar to the scientific process
        </p>
<p>
    8/28/23-Week 2 <br> We took the safety quiz today.We also did a worksheet on how inventions changed our way of living. We started tinkercad<br> at first we played around with all the tools and stuff then we started a challenge which was to make a household<br> appliance and I made a hair dryer. We also started desinging our Ruth goldberg machines.

    9/4/23-Week 3 <br> We finshed our tinkercad Rube Goldberg machine using simple machines. We also finsihed our Mechanical engineering worksheet,<br> we also watched a crash couse on the history of engineering. We took a quiz on the mechanical engineering worksheet.

    9/11/23 Week 4 <br> We started creating the Rube Goldberg machine with cardboard and got really far. We finished our machine and it popped our<br> ballon. We  used these three simple machines like Lever,inclined plane, and wheels and axel. It was a challenge<br> making the tinkercad into real life.

    9/18/23-Week 5 <br> On Monday we reviewed how to add videos into our website. On Tuesday we did two challenges, the first one was you had to build a boat<br> only using paper and tape, mine lasted two minutes and 40 seconds. My boat was shell shaped and floated.<br>The second challenge was we had at design an E by adding measurements then someone else would make it. We started a worksheet about computer engineering.

    9/25/23-Week 6 <br> We disected a computer and learned about the different parts like the CPU(Central processing unit), motherboard, cooling system, and GPU(Graphical processing unit) the CPU usually is the part that does the "computing" taking in an input and spewwing<br> an output, the motherboard is the circuitry tha powers or tells what, and when to do. The GPU is what creates your FPS or frames per second it is the graphical aspect of the computer.

       10/2/23-Week 7 <br> We learned about bioengineering and how it is the same and or different from mechanical engineering, we also did a worksheet because of the slides. we created a hand prothestic using cardboard and string.Our hand worked but it only worked once. We also created a tinkercad about a prothestic for an animal I created a leg prothesic for a Secratary bird.

        10/9/23-Week 8 <br> We started to learn about areospace engineering, it is engineering that is for planes, rockets, missiles, and satalettes literary anything that is in the air. We tinkercaded a 3d design for a rocket/planes that will be launch with air pressure. I chose this design because I have seen it in real life and i chose the pointy apex because it will be more aerodinamic.

        10/16/23-Week 9 <br> We created the bottle rocket we designed in tinkercad. Then we tested it but I was not there so I couldn't do it

        10/23/23-Week 10 <br> We learned about environmental engineering, it is about keeping us health by providing clean water and other items. We created a water filter made of cotton, rocks, sand, pebbles and coke bottles the first layer was made of cotton then sand then pebbles then rocks. Our filtered water was piss yellow.

        10/30/23-Week 11 <br> We learned about electrical engineering, it is about makung circits and makes electrical appliances. We learned about ressistance, current, voltage. We created different curcits in tinkercad by looking at the schematic one was a series circit and the other a with a parrallel.

        11/6/23-Week 12 <br> We created the circuits we made in tinkercad to a real life breadboard it was pretty easy because I understood how the breadboards worked,A challenge I faced was somtimes the wires would not go in, and i was scared to push in the wires harder because i thought it might break

    11/13/23-Week 13 <br> We learned about Business engineering what is about ethics and how money is managed, it is also is how ideas for businesses are made like shark tank. Our first idea was a license plate flipper so it would change your license plate to a different on so they can't tract it but then you said they had to be legal so we got stumped.

    11/27/23-Week 14 <br> We presented our Shark Tank idea which was a childless airline which would only permit people over the age of 18 to board. We asked for 150 million dollars for 40% of the company because a commercial plane cost about 50 million.

    1. What was the weight of your bridge? <br><li>ANSWER</li><br>
   2. What was the weight held by your bridge? <br><li>ANSWER</li><br>
   3. What was the ratio of weight of bridge to weight held?<br><li>ANSWER</li><br>
   4. What was the heaviest part of your bridge? What contributed most to the weight?<br><li>The part that contributed the most amount of weight was the "support triangles" which were double layered to insure maximum strength.The doubling of the spagetti added more weight while alos adding a bit of more strength.</li><br>
   5. Where did the design of your bridge come from? Inspiration? Research? <br><li>Our design inspiration was from a Howe Truss bridge. Which taught us that there are subtypes of types like 6 main bridge types and each of those have their own versions for the same bridge.</li><br>
   6. Did the design work as intended? Better? Worse?<br><li>Our design worked better than we thought because at the start we thought it wouldn't even hold one cup of water for how thin it was, we thought it would snap almost instantly.</li><br>
   7. What was the point of failure of your bridge? Was that the expected weakest point?<br><li>The point of failure was where the bucket was hung and a few inches away from where I held it. We expected the bucket holder place to be the weakest but we didn't plan for it to snap from where I held it. The place I held it from was also double layered so we thought it wouldn't break but it still snapped, but it also happened to the other side. </li><br>
   8. What can you do to improve your bridge? What can prolong points of failure?<br><li>If we had more spagetti we could have double layered everything and fixed the cross sections that broke while taking it off the sheet. We could have been more careful while prying it off the sheet. We could have also used more glue we were scared to use more because we thought we had too much, but when we saw the other teams which had glue bridges, but it was too late we couldn't glue it and dry it in time.</li><br>

    1/8/24 Sem2 Week 1 <br> We learned about chemical engineering which close to but not the same as a chemestry major, the difference is that chemical engineering focuses on expanding the chemical reaction to be mass produced in a factory like beer or other brands like that. While chemestry majors focus on creating new items useing chemicals with small reaction in a lab. We also made oobleck which is cornstrach mixed with water at the right pace and speed to reate a non-newtonian fluid

    1/15/24 Sem2 Week 2 <br> We started the proposal for our arduino car I wrote the description that we used electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering to create a design. We also did a BOM which are what materials you will be using. Our idea of our arduino car is two wheeled with a omnidirectional wheel in the back.

    1/22/24 Sem2 Week 3 <br> We started doing the coding and the wireing which is going great because we got the wheels to spin for 2 seconds clockwise and counterclockwise and then stop, but the wheels can't work at the same time because the chromebook doesn't have enough power to make both work. We are hoping to make the chasis and finish wiring and coding.
